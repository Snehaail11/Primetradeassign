# Sentiment vs Closed PnL Analysis

This project explores the relationship between **market sentiment classifications** and **trading performance**, measured by Closed PnL (Profit and Loss). Using real-world sentiment data, the analysis investigates whether emotional market states (like "Extreme Greed" or "Fear") have any measurable impact on profitability.

---

## Objective

To determine whether market sentiment correlates with Closed PnL and identify which emotional states (if any) tend to result in higher or lower profits.

---

## Dataset

- **Size**: 211,224 rows
- **Columns**: 
  - `date`: Trade or sentiment date  
  - `classification`: Market sentiment (e.g., Fear, Greed)  
  - `Closed PnL`: Profit/Loss for that trade  

---

## ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning

- Removed 0 PnL rows (106,816 rows)
- Removed NaN values (0 rows)
- Final dataset size: **104,408 rows**

---

## Analysis Performed

1. **Group-wise aggregation**:
   - Calculated **average**, **median**, and **count** of Closed PnL for each sentiment class.
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Bar plot of average Closed PnL per sentiment class.
3. **Sentiment Mapping**:
   - Converted sentiment to numeric scores:
     - `Extreme Fear` = 0, ..., `Extreme Greed` = 4
4. **Correlation Check**:
   - Computed Pearson correlation between sentiment score and Closed PnL.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- Weak positive correlation (**r = 0.0064**) between sentiment and Closed PnL.
- Some emotional extremes (e.g., Extreme Greed) showed larger PnL fluctuations.
- No strong linear relationship; sentiment alone does **not predict profitability**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Libraries Used

- Python `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

While market sentiment reflects the emotional state of the market, this analysis shows that it doesnâ€™t strongly correlate with profitability. Traders should use sentiment in combination with other indicators for better decision-making.
